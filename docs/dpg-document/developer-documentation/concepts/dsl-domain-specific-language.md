# DSL(Domain specific language)

A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is a specialized programming or scripting language focused on a specific problem domain. It is different from traditional programming languages (like Java, Python, or C++) because it provides commands and syntax tailored to express solutions directly within a particular field. In the context of this application, the DSL allows you to manage workflows, configure settings, and define logic without needing deep programming expertise.

**Benefits of Using DSL to Drive the Application**

* Flexibility: By using DSL, users with minimal programming experience can still make significant changes to how the application behaves, reducing dependency on developers for day-to-day configurations.
* Efficiency: Changes can be made quickly and safely without deep technical knowledge or the need to modify complex underlying code.
* Readability: The DSL’s domain-specific nature makes it more readable and understandable to non-developers who are familiar with the application’s core domain.
