# Vocabulary

### Batch

* A production unit created from raw materials.
* Ensures consistency and uniformity in the final product.
* Identified by a unique batch number for tracking and quality control.

### Lot

* A dispatch unit for transferring raw materials or processed products.
* Facilitates logistics and movement through different stages.
* Tracked with a unique identifier for quality assurance and traceability.
* Single lot will have units from a single batch

### Sample

* A Sample taken for lab test from a batch or lot.
* Used for quality testing in a laboratory.
* Helps ensure the entire batch or lot meets required standards.

### Dispatch

* The process of sending a lot or sample from one manufacturer/unit to another manufacturer/unit.
* Part of the transition process from one manufacturer/unit.
* Ensures materials move efficiently through different stages.

### Approval

* The process of accepting a lot or batch at the receiving stage.
* Involves checking compliance with quality and specification requirements.
* Necessary before the material is accepted for further processing.

### Reject

* Happens when a lot or batch does not meet required standards.
* The material is not accepted for further processing.
* Will be returned to the supplier, reworked, or discarded.

### Categories

* Different stages or classifications within the production or supply chain.
* Examples include Premix, FRK, FR etc.
* Helps organize and manage the life cycle of the product.

States

* Indicate the current progress of a batch or lot.
* Examples include "Created," "Approved," "Rejected," "SampleInLab," and "Dispatched."
* Tracking states helps monitor the workflow and ensures efficiency.



### Example Use Case:

A batch is considered a production unit, while a lot is a dispatch unit. For instance, in Manufacturing Unit A, 100 MT of Fortified Rice Kernels (FRK) is produced daily. This 100 MT is tested in the lab and then packed into 20 bags of 50 kg each. This 100 MT constitutes a batch, for which the manufacturer has test results.

The 100 MT can be distributed as follows:

* 70 MT to Miller A
* 30 MT to Miller B

In this scenario:

* The 70 MT dispatched to Miller A is considered one lot.
* The 30 MT dispatched to Miller B is considered another lot.

Once Miller A receives the lot and acknowledges receipt, Miller A can either:

* Send a sample from the 70 MT to the lab for further testing, or
* Approve/reject/return the lot based on the batch test results attached.

Similarly, Miller B can:

* Send a sample from the 30 MT to the lab for testing, or
* Approve/reject/return the lot based on the batch test results attached.
