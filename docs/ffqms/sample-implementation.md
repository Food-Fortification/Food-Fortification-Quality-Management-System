# Sample Implementation

* We can use the existing repositories to configure our sample implementation for fortifying Rice.
* If we want to override or add any new functionalities, we can make the changes in existing repositories or we can write wrapper applications on top of these repositories to add new functionalities
* Using these services sample UI implementation is added to visualize these functionalities
* Food Fortification Quality Management System (FFQMS) is used for Rice as a product
* Rice fortification stands as a crucial measure in combating anemia and addressing micronutrient deficiencies by infusing iron, folic acid (Vitamin B6), and Vitamin B12 into its composition. This intricate process involves coordination and workflows between various stakeholders. Ensuring that fortified rice adheres to the policies and guidelines of a specific geographic region necessitates the establishment of a robust infrastructure for quality control and assurance. The paramount objective lies in instituting an airtight process to guarantee the production and distribution of fortified rice of desired quality to consumers, thus advancing the mission to alleviate chronic nutritional deficiencies.
* Rice Fortification (FFQMS) platform contains below categories for the product
  1. Premix manufacturer (**Premix**) — Prepares the premix of micronutrients (Iron, Folic acid, and Vitamin B12)
     * The premix manufacturer employs the FFQMS software for key tasks including entering raw material details, batch creation, sending samples to the lab, and dispatching batches to the FRK manufacturer. After inputting raw material information, batches are generated and samples are sent for analysis, with lab reports automatically updating batch statuses. Upon receiving batches, the FRK manufacturer reviews lab reports and either accepts or rejects the material, with rejected batches returned to the premix manufacturer.
  2. Testing lab — Evaluates rice lot samples for quality and gives approval for lot dispatch.
     * Laboratory users can log in to the portal and access a comprehensive list of samples dispatched from vendors. Upon receipt of these samples, acknowledgements can be promptly issued to the respective vendors. Subsequently, the laboratory user conducts tests based on the sample’s condition and uploads the resulting data. In instances where the sample condition is deemed unsatisfactory, the laboratory user can reject the sample, accompanied by pertinent comments and the date of rejection.
  3. FRK manufacturer — Procures rice-mix (broken rice powder) from vendor and blends it with micronutrient premix to create fortified rice kernels (**FRK**).
     * The FRK manufacturer procures premix powder and rice flour from external suppliers to craft fortified rice kernels (FRK). Upon receipt of these ingredients, a sample FRK batch undergoes rigorous testing in a laboratory. Upon approval, the batch is dispatched to the rice miller. At the FRK vendor level, two distinct roles, Approver and User, are established, each endowed with administrative privileges. The Approver oversees the reception of premix lots, conducts quality verification, initiates lab tests if necessary, and renders decisions on lot approval. Conversely, the User is tasked with creating rice flour and FRK batches, dispatching approved batches to the miller, and coordinating lab assessments. Upon dispatch from the premix vendor, lots are registered and subject to rigorous scrutiny by the Approver. Approved lots serve as vital inputs in FRK batch creation, where raw materials are automatically selected, initiating batch generation. Following batch creation, samples are forwarded to the lab for testing. Positive lab results prompt batch dispatch to the mill, while unsatisfactory results lead to rejection. Upon receipt, the miller may opt for additional testing, ensuring the highest quality standards are met.
  4. Rice mill (**Miller**) — Receives FRK from warehouse and blends FRK with natural rice to create fortified rice.
     * The miller’s pivotal role in the rice fortification supply chain involves testing and verifying raw materials from the FRK manufacturer before incorporating them into fortified rice production. Miller manufacturers, utilizing FFQMS, designate two roles: Approver and User, responsible for quality assurance and batch creation, respectively. Integration of raw materials into the organizational portal ensures seamless batch creation, with approved lots used as input materials. After creation, batches undergo lab testing, with satisfactory results leading to automatic approval for dispatch, while unsatisfactory findings prompt rejection.
  5. **Warehouse** manager — Receives FRK lot from FRK manufacturer, sends FRK lot to rice mill. Receives fortified rice lot from rice mill, dispatches fortified rice lot to FCI warehouse.
     * The warehouse is the fourth entity in the rice fortification supply chain. Upon receiving lots from both the miller and FRK vendors, the warehouse has the authority to either directly accept or reject the lots. Rejected lots are promptly returned to the miller or FRK vendor. Alternatively, the warehouse may opt to send a sample from the lot to a local lab for self-certification. If the lab report indicates that the results fall within acceptable parameters, the lots are automatically accepted. However, if the lab report reveals deviations from the prescribed standards, the lots are rejected.
