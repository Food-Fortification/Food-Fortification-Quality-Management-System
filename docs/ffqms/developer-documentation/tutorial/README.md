# Tutorial



In this tutorial we will walk you through the first steps of getting the Food Fortification project up and running.

The tutorial is organized into three main sections: an **Overview of Our Technologies and Framework**, where we discuss the tools and libraries powering our app; **Setting Up the Project**, with step-by-step guidance for configuration; and **Diving into the Code**, which explores the core components and logic.

We will focus on things specific to our project. But there will be links to other tutorials and resources about the basics of the technologies we use.

If anything is unclear or missing, please open an issue on GitHub. Your questions and feedback are very welcome!
